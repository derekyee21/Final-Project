We interpret that these results show that the diversity of Alphaproteobacteria and their correlation with various environmental factors such as soil pH and soil temperature give insight into distribution patterns and ecological preferences of the Alphaproteobacteria taxonomic group. It suggests that microbial communities, like Alphaproteobacteria, are influenced by and also influence their surrounding ecosystem sites by highlighting different aspects such as genomic assembly quality, taxonomy, and environmental factors. Future implications for wetland management can be utilized by increasing our understanding that these relationships help predict the impacts of nutrient loading on microbial communities and can guide conservation efforts.The study is limited by its reliance on only two seasons of data, which may not capture all the seasonal variations in microbial activity.
